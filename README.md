**Objective:** Implement Angular authentication with Satellizer. My goal was to have working sign up and log in functionality. The course of this project took an entire afternoon.

1. Once you're in the app directory, run `npm install` to install the required `node_modules`.
2. In one Terminal window, run `mongod`, and in another, run `nodemon`.
3. Navigate to `localhost:9000` in the browser.
