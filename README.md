**Objective:** Implement Angular authentication with Satellizer. Fully functional sign up, log in, and log out functionality. The course of this project took an entire afternoon. I improved upon the app and included a delete function for the posts.

1. Once you're in the app directory, run `npm install` to install the required `node_modules`.
2. In one Terminal window, run `mongod`, and in another, run `nodemon`.
3. Navigate to `localhost:9000` in the browser.
